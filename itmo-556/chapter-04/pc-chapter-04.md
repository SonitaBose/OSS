## 12:30 What is the Fedora release cycle and can businesses use this release cycle?

Fedora is a true free and open source software which is managed by Redhat but its contributors are mostly volunteers and policies are driven by the user community. Redhat provides some resources like bandwidth and storage. This enables Fedora to make new releases every 6 months. If a business were to use Fedora, it will have to carry out system updates every six months. The overhead and risks for such activity is not something a business can afford. Redhat Enterprise version has a guarantee of support for seven years. They do release updates and versions to their operating system core and utilities but they are not as frequent as Fedora. They will target a particular Fedora release and then carry out thorough due diligence before incorporating the changes to the RHEL source. Then after full blown software and hardware testing , user groups , software vendors and hardware vendors certify the release. It may take six to twelve months to do that. That is why RHEL versions appear every once a few year.

## 13:30 What is the relationship between Fedora and Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)?

Fedora is not a beta version of RHEL. RHEL picks up selective mods and enhancements from the core and allied software of Fedora before integrating it with their own code after intense testing and customization. RHEL may raise bugs with Fedora too if it part of their code. Current Fedora Release is a picture of the future RHEL Release but it will be selective. Fedora is the Research and Development facility of RHEL and its engineers will be contributing to both Fedora and RHEL codes.

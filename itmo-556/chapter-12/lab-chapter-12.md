## 1.Using two virtual machines, while powered off, in the VirtualBox settings, enable a second network interface and set the type to host-only (details are in last chapter and the VirtualBox networking details are in chapter 03). 
a. You will be modifying the IP address of both of these systems: 192.168.33.10 and 192.168.33.11, netmask is 255.255.255.0 and gateway should be 10.0.2.2 (this is due to VirtualBox). 

b. Configure these settings in Network Manager for the respective Virtual Machines. 

c. Capture a screen shot of each system using the ping tool to ping the other IP and its results. 

d. Modify the /etc/hosts file and add an entry for both system in both systems 

e. Execute the ping command again this time using the hostname declared in the /etc/hosts file.

## 2.Repeat the above exercise but deactivate NetworkManager in systemctl and activate systemd-networkd (CentOS) 
a. In addition, on Ubuntu modify the Netplan conf to use networkd and place your YAML configuration there.

## 11.Repeat the install process above, this time using two servers, with static IP addresses configured, placing the MySQL database on a separate IP address -- configuring Wordpress properly and installing all needed pre-reqs.

a. Make sure to open the proper firewall ports and note that the first server will be the webserver and requires the apache2, php, php-mysql, and the php-client library only.

b. The second database server requires the Mysql-server package. Make one to be Ubuntu one to be Fedora/CentOS.

## 13.Create a fresh Ubuntu Virtual Machine and create a shell script that will automate the installation of the following and their dependencies: 
a. Install and Active Firewalld, open ports 22, 80, 443 

b. Download and install latest Wordpress tarball (look at using sed -i to do an inplace substitution of the default values in the wordpress config file) 

 
c. Firewall to only allow single IP connection for SSH and port 80 and 443 (that IP being a second virtual machine with a static IP assigned) 

d. Modify /etc/hosts to include these entries and take a screenshot of the output of your firewall status as well as you accessing the Wordpress blog via the browser using the hostname configured in /etc/hosts on the remote machine.

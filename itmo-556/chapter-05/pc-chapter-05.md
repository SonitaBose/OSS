## 2:25 Why did Randal’s previous employer have a large (1000s) Red Hat system deployed? 
Randal's employer had large (1000s) Red Hat system deployed since support was available 24 x 7.

---

## 3:40 What is the short story about how Centos came about? 
When Red Hat Linux Enterprise version went to the subscription model they kept their source code open.
Centos uses the same code without any of the branding to build their own operating system that is totally binary compatible with Redhat Linux but runs on community support model 
or any other alternative source of support.

---

## 4:58 Who is the largest commercial Enterprise Linux?  
RHEL is the largest commercial Enterprise Linux.

---

## 7:17 How do the two projects relate to each other? How do they relate to each other from the RedHat point of view? 
The two projects do not relate with each other as Redhat keeps its source code open. 
Centos or anybody else can start a distro with their code. 
The benefit that Redhat Tech or Engineering gets is that Centos is a source of many user requests for modifications and enhancements as well as bug requests. 
The Centos community too pitches in to diagnose and troubleshoot issue. The Redhat Sales and Marketing will not like Centos offering their distribution free.

---

## 8:10 Who from RedHat is not happy with Centos? 
The Redhat Sales and Marketing is not happy with Centos offering their distribution free.

---

## 10:25 How do Centos users differ from RedHat’s paying customers? 
Centos users may use a different kernel, or use it on a hardware that Redhat may not support or run it is an environment that Redhat doesn’t endorse.

---

## 19:00. How does the RHEL environment work vs Fedora environment? (RedHat Enterprise Linux) 
RHEL promises a backward compatibility of 7 years, so you need not worry about any add on products or hardware failing to work after a new release patch. 
Fedora is quick to grab leading edge changes , whiz bang, display and graphics and issues a release every six moth.That is not the kind of stability a server user will like.

---

## 22:55 Since Centos is using the RHEL code base how long does Centos lag behind the RHEL codebase when a new release is issued? 
They can come up with a Centos version of the latest RHEL Release in 24 hours unless there are some big changes to test, in that case they may sag for a few weeks.

---

## 24:24 How does Centos make money? 
Centos makes no money.The company has 10 employees and they do not work for the money but to consume the product.

---

## 29:00 How does Centos pay for everything? 
All there hardware is based on data farms of some of its users who have donated them along with bandwidth.

---

## 30:00 Who was Lance Davis and what happened with him? 
Lance Davis was one of the person involved with the Centos from the beginning and looked after the administration side of Centos. He had to leave the team as he could not provide the time needed towards the project and balance it with the time needed at home.

## 35:00 Kiran mentioned 2 million users for Centos - what did they do right compared to other projects (whitebox linux) that didn’t make it? 
One of the key decision taken at Centos was to keep binary compatibility with Redhat. Other than that they were focused on maintaining their open source model and pushing on their user education channels to work in their favour.

## 44:00 Is Centos for Servers only or can you use it on the Desktop? 
Yes, it can be used as a desktop operating system. However if you are looking for bells and whistles then you will be disappointed. It works fine as a desktop.

## Personal questions - is what Centos doing legal? Is it ethical/moral? Why or why not?
We have three distributions Fedora, RHEL and CentOS that comply to GPLv2 Free Software. All the three of them have built their distribution on common code and they freely use the upgrades and enhancements of the source code contributors of all the three distributions add, in their own releases.
What is more intriguing is that RHEL engineers too contribute to Fedora and CentOS. The three of them form an ecology that is beneficial to all of them. Fedora is the most dynamic distribution that can have a release every six months or so. It incorporates many modifications which may not be in the focus region of server integrators, for example graphics capabilities and desktop utilities. RHEL is the distribution that creates a distribution that focuses on certain hardware and platforms which are used by business users. They make a release once a year or so and provide support for seven years, which is something the business user appreciates and is willing to pay money for. CentOS is distribution that picks up the Last RHEL release and then removes all RedHat proprietary material from the build along with Redhat logos and trademarks, does a quality Assurance and releases it as a true blue FOSS distribution. There is very little value addition by the CentOS engineers. The CentOS community has very little to add except that they are a good source to look for bug reports. 
Is it ethical/moral for CentOS to create a distribution which is a RHEL clone?
Well they are totally legal as far as FOSS license GPLv2 criteria. They do not really make any money out of the effort. So I guess all they do is to provide an RHEL distribution without the conditions that come along with RHEL regarding the hardware platforms and other things. The user is able to use other add on products that RedHat provides. The Redhat had a problem earlier with its logo and brand names appearing on the screens, but after it has been removed they do not have any qualms. Neither do I.

# Chapter 2 Review Questions						

## 1.	Based on the movie’s tone and rhetoric - why do you think there was an anti-Microsoft tone at the time of the movies making (~2001)? (You may need to research Microsoft anti-trust case ).
Microsoft was using monopolistic restrictive practices like bundling of the Internet Explorer Web Browser with its Windows OS, thus preventing the growth of other browser products like Netscape. Microsoft manipulated its hardware vendors and other software product developers to have dependency on Internet Explorer browser. Independent software developers did not like the hegemony and coercive behavior of Microsoft.

## 2.	When Bill Gates wrote his 1976 “Open Letter to Hobbyists”, was he justified in his complaint? Why or why not?

Yes, Bill Gates was justified for making this complaint. The total cost of ownership of a computer system is hardware, software plus support on both hardware and software. The letter Bill wrote was addressed to hobbyists, not businesses that used computer professionally. His peeve was that whatever software was available on the personal computer kits like Altair 8800 designed at MITS was made by coding and using computers by engineers like him at a cost of $ 40K. Since the product was shareable, people saved money by not buying a copy of the products like Altair Basic. As a result of that they are doing a disservice to the hobbyist crowd because the pricing of the product included future expenses like debugging and versions with better functionality.

## 3.	Would Richard Stallman enter into a discussion on which is a better product: Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer? Why or why not? Would Eric S. Raymond enter into a discussion on which is a better product: Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer? Why or why not?

Both Richard Stallman and Eric S. Raymond support Free Software as it was known in the early days. Free Software meant free to modify and update the functionalities of the product. However later the concept developed into Open Systems Software where the distribution came along with the source code. Since someone took the responsibility of maintaining the stability of the current code being handed out as well as could be counted on to remove bugs when discovered, the distributor has rights to charge money for the product. Eric understood and stood by this concept but Richard wanted the cost of developing and maintenance of the code to be borne by the software community pro bono. So Richard will not enter into a discussion on which is a better product: Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer as both ask to be paid but offer continued support in return.

## 4.	Why did Bruce Perens help write the Open Source Definition / Debian Social Contract Standard?

	Bruce realized that while the GPL perfectly defined the Free Software concept under which the GNU version of Unix was packaged and distributed, the Open Systems Software distribution did not have a legal definition and the GPL did not cover it. There has to be an understanding between the developers, the distributors and the users of the version which is defined by the Open Source Definition.
	The basic guidelines are mentioned below 
		1.Free redistribution. That does not mean without paying.
		2.Inclusion of source code.
		3.Allowing for modifications and derived works.
		4.Integrity of the author's source code (as a compromise).
		5.No discrimination against persons or groups.
		6.No discrimination against fields of endeavor, like commercial use.
		7.The license needs to apply to all to whom the program is redistributed.
		8.License must not be specific to a product.
		9.License must not restrict other software.

## 6.	What is Red Hat Linux’s stock price today compared to the price listed in the movie? What is VA Linux’s stock price today compared to the movie? (Hint VA Linux was sold and now belongs to another company, find that company’s stock price.) 
RHAT is no longer traded in NASDAQ stock exchange. It is traded in NYSE Red Hat Linux   RHT $ 187.71. In the movie the stock price was $276.16 on NASDAQ stock exchange.
In the movie the stock exchange price for VA Linux was $265.V A Linux’s history to change to GME. Currently Gamestop GME $ 3.65 (V A Linux)

## 7.	According to Eric S. Raymond what was the major application that needed to “flip” for opensource to become a viable enterprise  	solution? 

The major application that was required were database products like Oracle and Sybase.

## 8.	What was the first major commercial company to opensource a key product? What did that product eventually become? 

The first major commercial company to opensource a key product was Netscape Navigator. Netscape was taken over by an open source organization mozilla.org. Later made a browser called Firefox and is still available.

## 9.	How does Richard Stallman react at the end of the movie to the success of the Linux kernel to the exclusion of the GNU                   toolchain?
Richard Stallman’s reaction to Linus Torvalds getting the Free Software Foundation was 
“Giving the Linus Torvalds Award to the Free Software Foundation is a bit like giving the Han Solo Award to the Rebel Alliance.”
Richard Stallman spoke about the GNU utility which was wrapped around a proprietary Unix kernel until Linus Torvalds created an 	original kernel and named it Linux. He wanted to emphasize that it should be known as Gnu Linux which was created to get rid of 	proprietary software’s grip on computing.

## 10.	What is the main difference between “Free Software” and “Open Source Software”?

To a layman, OpenSource and Free Software have no difference at all. But if one looks closer, their names reflect their character. Both of the ideologies aim to serve the community but there is a difference in how they have been perceived and their approach.
	
Free Software is OpenSource's elder brother in age , but they didn’t seem to get along and while I was judging their egoistic differences, I realized the devil is in the details and the feud is probably understandable
	
When Free Software came into existence, the perception was that FSF wanted to promote zero cost software. As we know there are no free lunches in life, this was frowned upon by folks who believed in quality. They felt free software just meant people were getting poorly produced freebies to play with. The foundation was not able to clearly outline the win-win motive of the movement, which OpenSource eventually did. OpenSource declared that their ideology behind branding the concept as "OpenSource" was that it implied that people were not only going to be able to use the free source code but also had the right to freely modify the source code to contribute to the growth and development of the software in question and felt that the term "Open Source" was would place more value on the positive impact people of the community could make to the product rather than giving them just the benefit of using it for free.

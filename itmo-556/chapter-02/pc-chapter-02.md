# Chapter 2 Podcast Questions  								

## 1.	7:21 Who is Vicky Brasseur and what does she do?
Vicky Brasseur used to run software engineering departments for businesses of different sizes at VP/Director Level for the last 20 years. She gave that up and became a freelancer consultant for corporates to help them contribute to, release and sustainably use and comply with free open system software. She understands business and has been consistently trying to contribute to the software community by assisting companies to make money from FOSS. Currently, she works as the Director of Open Source Strategy at Juniper Networks.

## 2.	8:45 What has changed the most in regard to the term OpenSource in the last 25+ years?

---

In the past, OpenSource implied software that was available for use, free of cost. However, over time people have gained more awareness and understating regarding the in-depth concept of OpenSource which stresses on the significance of the independence end users get to modify the publicly available source code for improvements.

---

## 3.	10:00 What is assumed to now be the default development pattern for new software?

OpenSource has become the base on which closed source software is built. People start with OpesnSource code, libraries and operating systems and then build their own code over it. The organizations need a business strategy in order to gain profits however the initial resources are open source and utilization of open source does not contribute to overheads. 

---

## 4.	13:00 According to Randall, when a company publishes its code as OpenSource, what do they gain?
Randall points out in the podcast, that when a company releases an OpenSource code to the community, they can benefit largely from developers who use the code and contribute to updating it for improvements and enhancements. Not only does this result in getting work done for free but also is also an effective way of building a community of contributors.

## 5.	15:57 What do companies struggle with when they decide to opensource their codebase and core-products and how do they solve it?

Companies that launch with an open source code base usually struggle to turn their product into profit due to releasing their code out with weakly strategized business models. Uploading a library on GitHub may attract users but doesn’t necessarily bring monetary benefits. Open source lowers the cost of ownership however is proportional with the productivity of management.
Some common ways of generating revenue is via consultant jobs, product services and support.


---

## 6.	19:00 What are some of the OpenSource companies?
Some of the OpenSource companies mentioned in the podcast are Horton Works, Mongo Db, RedHat, Unicorn.


---

## 7.	19:35 What are the majority of OpenSource companies’ strategies to make money?
Companies want to get acquired so that the VC is happy, and they exit with a positive return on investment.

---

## 8.	22:40 What do companies need to figure out about Free and OpenSource?
Companies need to understand that FOSS needs to be implemented as a business model to make profits, not just to confirm to the latest fashion trend of the technical community
They need to incorporate both ideas into their business model strategy.

---

## 9.	24:25 What is the term “Yak-Shaving” mean?
Yak Shaving refers to all the prep work required to address the actual requirement in the software. An example would be updating the version of the operating system to be compatible with the upgraded software with new desired features.

---

## 10.	27:25 Who is Vicky’s new book targeting?
FOSS is not just placing your library in the GitHub. There are other aspects that need to be built into it, like documentation, security, designers, translators,  dependency lists and these tasks must be accomplished keeping the FOSS concepts in mind. Vicky’s book will help forge the right software up for people to use and build their communities on.
Anyone looking to contribute to OpenSource will gain valuable insights from Vicky’s book. It’s not just meant for the developer community but anyone who wishes to participate can find a way to help and the book aims to guide them too.

---

## 11.	28:03 What is the book about?
Vicky’s book is about guiding people interested in FOSS to find opportunities to contribute to. The book not only has guidance for code related contributions, but also for other functional tasks associated with building a successful software project.
It can also help one chose an ideal project to contribute to.

---

## 12.	33:25 What is the mistaken impression about contributing to OpenSource Software?
People feel contributing to FOSS is to write new source code and push it into GitHub. But there are many other important contributions that can be done. The foremost would be to find a bug and fix it or if one doesn’t have the time, then just report it. It is equally important to request a modification the functionality to cover some very new and exciting business functions that may make the software very popular. Besides that, there are tasks like translating text, documentation, writing manuals, promoting the functions on bulletin boards and other networks.

---

## 13.	37:40 What do you need to read before contributing to an OpenSource project?
It is recommended that first time contributors work with a software project that has a contribution manual and follow it strictly. However, not every project follows a template, some may have an issue list page while others might have a mailing list, but one should ensure to follow the specifications provided by the project, if any.

---

## 14.	43:00 What does Vicky believe is important for a project to have and to enforce for a community?
Since FOSS is not just coding and software engineering but also a community, effective communication, procedures and codes of conduct are necessary to build a healthy environment. Enforcing the rules will ensure that we do not drive away valuable people, resources and opportunities.

---

## 15.	48:01 What is the myth about users of proprietary operating systems (Windows and MacOS)?
Gareth is concerned about the myth that users of proprietary Operating systems are not very enthusiastic about using FOSS based applications. However, in reality, such users end up using many FOSS applications on their proprietary operating systems and they should be encouraged to see the benefits of it. 

---

## 16.	49:00 Vicky used Linux for 10 years, what drove her away from it?
Vicky switched to MacOS because she felt she was using way too much time to get all the FOSS based applications for her day to day work to fall in line into the level of convenience she desired.

## 11.	Launch multiple tabs in Firefox using this command:
a)firefox -new-tab -url krebsonsecurity.com -new-tab -url twit.tv/floss/. Find the process IDs via ps -ef and kill those tabs/processes with a kill -2 command b) Repeat the above launch command and this time use systemd and the proper cgroups to kill the FireFox processes

## 20.	Install a copy of Devuan Linux from devuan.org. Take a screenshot of the ps -ef command focusing on PID 1. 
a) Install the openRC init system via sudo apt-get install openrc 
b) The install process asks you to run a command after succesful install: for file in /etc/rc0.d/K*; do s=`basename $(readlink "$file")` ; /etc/init.d/$s stop; done explain what this command is doing. c) Reboot the system and take a screenshot of the output of the ps -ef command focusing on PID 1

openRC init system
 for file in /etc/rc0.d/K*; 
do s=`basename $(readlink "$file")` ; 
/etc/init.d/$s stop;
Rc0 is the run level where the system shuts down. Run level 0 is to shut down the system. It contains scripts to stop daemons and services and run housekeeping jobs. The rc0.d contains files which are linked to scripts in init.d and those daemons are used to start and stop the daemons.

## 23.	Using GCC sudo dnf install gcc or sudo apt-get install build essential, create and compile a simple C++ code that is an infinite loop -- just put while true in the body of main. Execute this script (note you could do this in Python as well, your choice). Use systemd-cgtop to display the usage and capture that output.
a) use the ps and various filters to show only information related to this process. 
b) use the systemd-cgls command and filters to display the process information
 c) use the kill command from systemd to kill the cgroup related to the infinite loop process.

## 24.	Using the sample file located in: files > Chapter-10 > python > write-journal.py and copy it to your home directory. Create a systemd service file called write-journal.service. Have the service file execute this python script (use absolute paths). Use the commands to enable and start the service. Use the sudo journalctl -xe command to show the output in the systemd logs at boot and after the system has loaded.

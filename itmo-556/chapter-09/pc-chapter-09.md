## Link : NodeJS - https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/387       

## ~4:20 Where does Aaron (guy wearing black) say he is starting to see Node JS more and more? 
Aaron is starting to see Node JS more and more on IoT devices .

 ##  ~7:22 What is Node.js? 
Node.js is a Javascript platform that is completely browser dependent. Node.js offers multi-threaded VMs which allows huge scalability.

 ##  ~8:50 According to Mikeal, what are we seeing an explosion of? 
We are seeing an explosion of applications that are using full stack development using Node.js on desktops, mobile platforms and IoT devices.

 ##  ~9:15 What language(s) is NodeJS similar to?  
Node.js is similar to languages that are used on the browser like html, html5, javascript

 ##  ~9:35 What is Event Driven Programming?  
Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications (e.g., JavaScript web applications) that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input.
In plain words many languages allow you to associate a code to be run when a certain event occurs e.g. on a web, a user clicks on an object on the screen with the mouse, a piece of code gets executed. It can be an event detected on the sensors of an IoT device or someone accessing a port on a networking device. 

 ## ~10:45 what is NodeJS package manager/ecosystem?  
You write Node.js code in ordinary text files with an .js extension. Each such file is known as a module. 
NPM is the Node.js Package Manager which contains thousands of modules or free packages or JavaScript libraries that you can include in your code like you add packages in java code.

 ## ~12:05 what kind of things would use Node? 
 
 Node is used in IOT, lower power devices, tesla 2 rasberry pie , advanced compilers , react

 ##  ~17:20 What are the two popular desktop apps built in NodeJS that Mikael mentioned? 
Visual Studio Code Editor  and Collaboration App - Slack

 ##  ~ 19:30 What are some of the ways to learn NodeJS? 
Any mooc  is good enough to learn node.js.
The website below is one of the good ones to learn node.js yourselves

 ##  ~ 21:30 What did Microsoft do with NodeJS and where did it get Node? 
Microsoft submitted a pull request on the Node.js Git Hub and submitted a code that can run on their Chakra Core Java script Engine. ( https://www.infoworld.com/article/3024271/nodejs-welcomes-microsoft-chakra-javascript-engine.html  ) The built a Chakra shim on top of their core engine to emulate the Java V8 engine

 ##  ~ 22:30 Mikael mentions multiple languages: TypeScript, CoffeeScript, Electron, and Dart – what are they and how do they relate to the NodeJS project? (Need to do some side research) 
The languages mentioned in the are languages that are used to write scripts that ultimately convert to java script. The reason for using these languages is that users do not have to deal with the java script language which is not very readable and intuitive.

  ## ~25:27 What company started the NodeJS and eventually the NodeJS foundation? (Currently owned by Samsung) 
Joyent is the company that started NodeJs and the associated foundation

 ##  ~ 26:43 What does the NodeJS foundation do (what is its role?) 

The foundation gives full autonomy over the project.There is a sophisticated governance model built around creating a software model.It looked for high sustainable software for the github area and incorporate scalability and stability. This is one side controlled by the autonomous contributors of the foundation. The other side of the foundation have the members, the donating members, individuals and that and representative of the board handle taditional marketing and legal procedures. 

 ##  ~ 34:00 Who is the guest and what is his job? 
His job is lot of metrics and operational work.

 ##  ~ 38:48 How much did Mikael reduce his code when he switched from Python to NodeJS? 
He wrote thousands and thousands of lines of code to develop a proxy server in python. He had to write just 40 lines of code to achieve that in node.js

 ##  ~41:54 is is possible to run NodeJS for command line scripting? 
Yes

  ## ~45:00 Where is pretty much every NPM module hosted? 
on GitHub

 ## ~47:40 What is the Go language good at and what is it not? 
Go language good at networking. 
It is not good for desktop apps or GUI based apps
While Go can talk to native system functions, it's not as good a fit for creating extremely low-level system components, like embedded systems design, kernels, or device drivers.

 ## ~50:55 Is there any relationship between NodeJS and Docker?
No. Both are part of the FLOSS community. Docker wants to stay  language neutral . Node.js doesn’t have any dependency on Docker either but they do benefit from the community.

LAB 8 


## 1.	What would be the command to create an array in Bash named itemARRAY?

declare -a itemARRAY

---

## 2.	Write a shell script that declares an array in Bash named dirarr. Using the mapfile command - redirect the output of the ls -l ~ command into the array previously named and echo out the 3rd and 4th elements of that array.

## 3.Write a for loop to iterate through that array and print every element of the line out on the screen. (Make sure you detect the length of the array and use a $LENGTH variable as your sentinel condition.

## 4.	Write the syntax to make a cronjob execute 5 minutes past every hour everyday to execute the shellscript you previously made to store the content of ls -l ~ into an array named dirarr.

	5 * * * * /home/sonita/q2.sh 


---

## 5.	From the clones textbook code, locate the file install-java8.sh located in the files/Chapter-08/lab directory. Modify the script to include IF statements to check for the existence of the path /datapool1 and to print an error message if the path does not exist.

---

## 6.	Modify install-java8.sh again--this time take a positional parameter and put that in place of the directory name /datapoo1 (this will allow you to customize the install location of the shell script).

:%s/\/datapool1/\$1/g
To run the script type 
./ install-java-8-open-jdk.sh /datapool1

---

## 7.Modify the install-java8.sh from the previous question to count the number of positional parameters and if less than 1 or more than 1 stop execution of the script.

## 8.Create a directory in ~ named topsecret. In that directory create a file named xfile.txt. Write a shell script to check if that file has executable permission by passing the filename as a positional parameter. If TRUE print a message. If FALSE print an error message that the positional parameter name of the file is not executable.It shows it does not have any executable permissions

If TRUE print a message else print an error message with the given file name being passed.

---

## 11.Write a shell script that takes 4 positional parameters. In the shell script print out $0, $#, and $@ with an explanation of what these variables contain.

---

## 12.Repeat the previous cron command but this time redirect the standard out and standard error to a file named ~/Documents/my.log
5 * * * * sudo /home/sonita/q2.sh >> ~/Documents/my.log 2>&1

---

## 13.	Using awk and other tools, how would you find which ip caused the most HTTP 404 errors? Take a screenshot of the command and the output. 
Use these two files in files/Chapter-08/logs: u_ex150721.log, u_ex151002.log.

## 14.Using awk and other tools, how would you capture the top 5 offending IPs? Take a screenshot of the command and the output. Use these two files in files/Chapter-08/logs: u_ex150721.log, u_ex151002.log.

## 15.Using sed, type the command to find the line bind-address located in the mariadb database server config file (you might need to install mariadb-server). The file locations are: Fedora 28 /etc/my.cnf.d/mariadb-server.cnf and Ubuntu 16 and 18 /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf. Comment out the value, change the IP value to 0.0.0.0, and write the change back to the original file. Take a screenshot of the command.

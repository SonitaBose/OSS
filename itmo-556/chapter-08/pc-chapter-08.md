## 7:59 Why was Brian Fox the perfect person to develop the Bash Shell? 
The objective of the FSF set up by Richard Stahlman was to create a shell that could do whatever Bourne Shell could do so that users didn’t have to learn new syntax but the code of the package shouldn’t have any similarities with the Bourne Shell code. 
It needed someone who has never seen the Bourne Shell code which was proprietary but available with the University Computer Departments. 
Brian Fox was a 20 year old high school dropout who learnt to code on his own. He was the right person to do the job as he was never in the University environment.

## 9:30 How long did it take to create the Bash shell and what was difficult about this? 
It took Brian 9 months to create the Bash shell. There were two reasons that made it difficult to achieve the task quicker. 
The first constraint was that the new shell had to be fully compatible with bash shell users but at the same time offer better and newer functionalities. 
The second problem was that the POSIX committee that tries to standardize all kinds of interfaces in the computer world decided to look into the shells in use in Unix. While Brian was working on his shell, Korn was creating his shell the ksh. He had a better hold in the POSIX committee and Brian had to argue his way to ensure that the POSIX did not adopt measures that made the standard shell worse or difficult to manage.

---

## 12:02 What did Brian accidentally do to the Bash Shell? 
Brian accidently deleted all his source program file while removing a file named ‘*.c’. If you run the command without the quotes it will delete all files with a file type ‘.c’ . His version of the shell failed to recognize the quotes because he had not implemented the quoting feature.
